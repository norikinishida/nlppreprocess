the fat cat sat on the mat .
`` get off ! ''
said the rat .
but the fat cat just sat .
so the rat got his bat .
then the rat got his hat .
will the rat and the bat and the hat get the fat cat off the mat ?
yesterday , i went to the laboratory and found a fat dog sitting on my chair .
however , i love a dog too .
so i studied on the mat with a rat .
